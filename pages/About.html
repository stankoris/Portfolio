        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>&#128075; Hi! My name is Stanko Risimiƒá and I am from Serbia üá∑üá∏. If you don't know where that is, check it <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 238, 255);" href="./mapaSrbije.html">here</a> &#128517; </p>
        <p>What would I say about myself... &#129300; Let's start from the beginning</p>
        <p>I was born on September 23, 1998. in Kraljevo. I grew up in the village of Medveƒëa (near Trstenik) and finished elementary school there. After that, I attended a medical high school in ƒåaƒçak &#128218;</p>
        <p>Immediately after finishing school, I started working. I  worked various jobs from a bakery salesman to a supervisor and then a medical technician. <br>
            However, over time, I became interested in programming so in 2021 I decided to enroll in <b>IT Academy</b>. <br>
            What was my experience like? Well...</p>
        <p>As someone who had no understanding of programming, I decided to start with <b>Java </b>üôÉ.  <br>
            I soon realized that programming was not easy, especially when you know nothing about it. <br>
            At that time I was working so after my shift I would rush to school to attend the class. When I got home I would sit down to practice what we had learned that day. <br>
            The first few days of lectures were exciting but after a while I found myself lacking motivation and feeling tired. It seemed to me that the more I learned the less I knew. <br> 
            In that period I also became a member of <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(0, 238, 255);" href="https://www.mensa.org/">Mensa</a>.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the year, I had to undergo surgery, so I was forced to stop studying. The recovery lasted almost until mid-2022, but when I recovered, my desire for success was even greater. However, after returning to Belgrade I found a job and again had to stop studying for a few weeks because I didn't have the time. Only after a few months when I found a stable job and created some time for myself did I start learning again. I found myself in an unenviable situation where I quickly realized that I had forgotten everything I had learned up to that point &#129301;</p>
        <p>The beginning was tough but my desire to learn programming was stronger. I studied during all my free time. One day I  was at job fair, and there I got the opportunity to get a three-month programming internship. I was already working but that did not stop me from accepting the offer. After many sleepless nights, I managed to complete the three-month programming internship, which greatly helped me understand how everything works</p>
        <p>Thus in January 2024 I successfully finished IT Academy and became a certified Java developer. After that, I started learning more about JavaScript. Went to Kotor to practice at my friend's factory and completed two courses on freeCodeCamp for backend and frontend (Node.js, React.js)</p>
        <p>Now I am back again and it's time for the next step in my career üòÄ</p>
